Willott, Zihao Wu",2025-07-30 17:59:56,"The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at $z > 11$ revealed by JWST has
sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms
regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but
so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA
observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z > 11$ galaxy that
bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data
confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance,
precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with
JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu <
9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of
$\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass
of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all
$3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm
0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that
redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even
spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential
damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic
overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity
of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$,
meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs
given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved
MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to
consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star
formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~30% solar), only 400 Myr
after the Big Bang.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22888v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22888v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22888v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.165432
Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning,"Kwesi Cobbina, Tianyi Zhou",2025-07-30 17:59:46,"In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22887v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.174979

Floquet Spin Splitting and Spin Generation in Antiferromagnets,"Bo Li, Ding-Fu Shao, Alexey A. Kovalev",2025-07-30 17:59:07,"In antiferromagnetic spintronics, accessing the spin degree of freedom is
essential for generating spin currents and manipulating magnetic order, which
generally requires lifting spin degeneracy. This is typically achieved through
relativistic spin-orbit coupling or non-relativistic spin splitting in
altermagnets. Here, we propose an alternative approach: a dynamical spin
splitting induced by an optical field in antiferromagnets. By coupling the
driven system to a thermal bath, we demonstrate the emergence of steady-state
pure spin currents, as well as linear-response longitudinal and transverse spin
currents. Crucially, thermal bath engineering allows the generation of a net
spin accumulation without relying on spin-orbit coupling. Our results provide a
broadly applicable and experimentally tunable route to control spins in
antiferromagnets, offering new opportunities for spin generation and
manipulation in antiferromagnetic spintronics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22884v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22884v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22884v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.174979
Operational interpretation of the Stabilizer Entropy,"Lennart Bittel, Lorenzo Leone",2025-07-30 17:58:40,"Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching
applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of
quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding
of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,
nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress
is the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible
magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational
interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this
work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property
testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable
magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state
becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate
governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available
copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state
$k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we
establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state
from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.
These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes
the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby
offering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a
quantum resource.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22883v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22883v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22883v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.185849
Non-classicality at equilibrium and efficient predictions under non-commuting charges,"Lodovico Scarpa, Nishan Ranabhat, Amit Te'eni, Abdulla Alhajri, Vlatko Vedral, Fabio Anza, Luis Pedro García-Pintos",2025-07-30 17:57:06,"A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but
the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully
understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent
approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We
extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it
can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables
without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do
not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus
providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this
approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and
play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of
observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges'
non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium,
which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus
uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under
non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability
distributions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22882v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22882v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22882v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.185849
AUV-Fusion: Cross-Modal Adversarial Fusion of User Interactions and Visual Perturbations Against VARS,"Hai Ling, Tianchi Wang, Xiaohao Liu, Zhulin Tao, Lifang Yang, Xianglin Huang",2025-07-30 17:55:09,"Modern Visual-Aware Recommender Systems (VARS) exploit the integration of
user interaction data and visual features to deliver personalized
recommendations with high precision. However, their robustness against
adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to
system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable
limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only
perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these
challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework
that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary
generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop
user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned
perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a
pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating
genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion
eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates
the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in
traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS
architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly
enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional
baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under
rigorous scrutiny.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22880v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22880v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22880v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.191388

intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants,
and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant
on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,
optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.
This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole
recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of
recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places
user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large
language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,
and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into
an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the
above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a
multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced
pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative
judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.
Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance
gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and
satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.
These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that
LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually

Automatically discovering heuristics in a complex SAT solver with large language models,"Yiwen Sun, Furong Ye, Zhihan Chen, Ke Wei, Shaowei Cai",2025-07-30 17:52:25,"Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven

Non-periodic Boundary Conditions for Euler Class and Dynamical Signatures of Obstruction,"Osama A. Alsaiari, Adrien Bouhon, Robert-Jan Slager, F. Nur Ünal",2025-07-30 17:49:19,"While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in
the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed
where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in
conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so
far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate
the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and
the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions.
Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to
obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both
generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler
class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two
dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the
possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We
establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns
according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant,
highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by
building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical
consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice
Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically
confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss
possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to
study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap

Tracking research software outputs in the UK,"Domhnall Carlin, Austen Rainer",2025-07-30 17:46:47,"Research software is crucial in the research process and the growth of Open

Research (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The
quantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to
other categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the
reported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous

star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains
elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In
this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the
emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I
protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and
L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly
face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the
centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto
the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the
inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common,
with warm ($T_{\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots
or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these
findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock
traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1)
the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope
outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum
through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the
centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is
pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling
motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and
those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in
different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest
that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like
inner envelope warrants further special attention.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22870v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22870v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22870v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.198775

Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue,"Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus",2025-07-30 17:41:14,"With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy,
development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available
computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources
are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy
states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are
commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely
focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a
rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key
observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize
it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM,
where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM.
Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to
sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available
jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We
show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the
form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on
the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22865v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.206855
Complex topologies in phase separated droplets predicted from universal phase diagram,"Amit Kumar, Gary H. Karpen, Samuel A. Safran",2025-07-30 17:37:21,"Phase separation of two phase separating solutes in a common solvent can
result in mesoscale (micron-sized) droplets with complex topologies of the
domains of each solute within each droplet. Such topologies have been observed
in-vitro in systems of chromatin oligomers, biomolecular condensates, and
polymeric mixtures. In these systems the solutes phase separate from the
solvent into droplets due to the relatively large free energy gain, which
includes the energies and entropies of mixing with the solvent. Within each
droplet, further phase separation can occur between the two solutes due to an
additional free energy difference that promotes their demixing; in some
systems, the extent of demixing can be, in some cases, be modulated by an
additional component. The minimal free energy topologies are predicted as
universal functions of the interfacial tension ratios and fractions of each

Synchronization of mean-field models on the circle,"Yury Polyanskiy, Philippe Rigollet, Andrew Yao",2025-07-30 17:31:57,"This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto

derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22857v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22857v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22857v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.206855
Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds: A Gradient-Free Projection-Based Approach,"Hongye Wang, Zhaoye Pan, Chang He, Jiaxiang Li, Bo Jiang",2025-07-30 17:24:27,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22855v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22855v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22855v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.214881
A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model,"Andris Ambainis, Joao F. Doriguello, Debbie Lim",2025-07-30 17:24:23,"We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a ""simulator"". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" and ""posterior sampling"" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22854v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1,2025-07-31T20:15:00.214881

sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms
regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but
so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA
observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z > 11$ galaxy that
bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data
confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance,
precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with
JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu <
9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of
$\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass
of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all
$3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm
0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that
redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even
spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential
damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic
overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity
of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$,
meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs
given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved
MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to
consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star

Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning,"Kwesi Cobbina, Tianyi Zhou",2025-07-30 17:59:46,"In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22887v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887v1,2025-07-31T20:26:41.717430

essential for generating spin currents and manipulating magnetic order, which

splitting induced by an optical field in antiferromagnets. By coupling the
driven system to a thermal bath, we demonstrate the emergence of steady-state
pure spin currents, as well as linear-response longitudinal and transverse spin
currents. Crucially, thermal bath engineering allows the generation of a net

Operational interpretation of the Stabilizer Entropy,"Lennart Bittel, Lorenzo Leone",2025-07-30 17:58:40,"Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching
applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of
quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding
of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,
nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress
is the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible
magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational
interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this
work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property
testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable
magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state
becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate
governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available
copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state
$k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we
establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state
from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.
These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes
the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby

not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus
providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this

limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only

that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary
generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop

pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating
genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion
eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates
the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in
traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS

This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole

highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by
building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical
consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice

elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In
this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the
emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I
protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and
L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly
face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the
centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto
the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the
inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common,
with warm ($T_{\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots
or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these
findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock
traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1)
the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope
outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum
through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the
centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is
pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling
motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and
those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in
different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest
that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like

Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue,"Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus",2025-07-30 17:41:14,"With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy,
development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available
computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources
are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy
states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are
commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely
focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a
rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key
observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize
it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM,
where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM.
Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to
sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available
jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We
show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the
form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on
the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22865v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865v1,2025-07-31T20:26:41.748859
Complex topologies in phase separated droplets predicted from universal phase diagram,"Amit Kumar, Gary H. Karpen, Samuel A. Safran",2025-07-30 17:37:21,"Phase separation of two phase separating solutes in a common solvent can
result in mesoscale (micron-sized) droplets with complex topologies of the
domains of each solute within each droplet. Such topologies have been observed
in-vitro in systems of chromatin oligomers, biomolecular condensates, and
polymeric mixtures. In these systems the solutes phase separate from the
solvent into droplets due to the relatively large free energy gain, which
includes the energies and entropies of mixing with the solvent. Within each
droplet, further phase separation can occur between the two solutes due to an
additional free energy difference that promotes their demixing; in some
systems, the extent of demixing can be, in some cases, be modulated by an
additional component. The minimal free energy topologies are predicted as
universal functions of the interfacial tension ratios and fractions of each
solute within a droplet. We compare the predictions with several experimental
systems to estimate the ranges of interfacial tensions. Experimental aspects
that may depend on the kinetics or molecular weight variations in the system

state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global

Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds: A Gradient-Free Projection-Based Approach,"Hongye Wang, Zhaoye Pan, Chang He, Jiaxiang Li, Bo Jiang",2025-07-30 17:24:27,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22855v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22855v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22855v1,2025-07-31T20:26:41.753798
A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model,"Andris Ambainis, Joao F. Doriguello, Debbie Lim",2025-07-30 17:24:23,"We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a ""simulator"". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" and ""posterior sampling"" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22854v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1,2025-07-31T20:26:41.753798

sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms
regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but
so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA
observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z > 11$ galaxy that
bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data
confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance,
precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with
JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu <
9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of
$\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass
of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all
$3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm
0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that
redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even
spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential
damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic
overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity
of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$,
meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs

MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to
consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star

Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning,"Kwesi Cobbina, Tianyi Zhou",2025-07-30 17:59:46,"In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22887v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887v1,2025-07-31T21:50:18.136983

splitting induced by an optical field in antiferromagnets. By coupling the
driven system to a thermal bath, we demonstrate the emergence of steady-state
pure spin currents, as well as linear-response longitudinal and transverse spin
currents. Crucially, thermal bath engineering allows the generation of a net

Operational interpretation of the Stabilizer Entropy,"Lennart Bittel, Lorenzo Leone",2025-07-30 17:58:40,"Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching
applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of
quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding
of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,
nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress
is the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible
magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational
interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this
work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property
testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable
magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state
becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate
governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available
copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state
$k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we
establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state
from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.
These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes
the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby

building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical
consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice

star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains
elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In
this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the
emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I
protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and
L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly
face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the
centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto
the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the
inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common,
with warm ($T_{\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots
or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these
findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock
traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1)
the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope
outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum
through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the
centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is
pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling
motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and
those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in
different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest
that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like
inner envelope warrants further special attention.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22870v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22870v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22870v1,2025-07-31T21:50:18.168968

Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue,"Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Sennur Ulukus",2025-07-30 17:41:14,"With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy,
development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available
computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources
are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy
states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are
commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely
focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a
rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key
observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize
it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM,
where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM.
Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to
sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available
jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We
show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the
form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on

Complex topologies in phase separated droplets predicted from universal phase diagram,"Amit Kumar, Gary H. Karpen, Samuel A. Safran",2025-07-30 17:37:21,"Phase separation of two phase separating solutes in a common solvent can
result in mesoscale (micron-sized) droplets with complex topologies of the
domains of each solute within each droplet. Such topologies have been observed
in-vitro in systems of chromatin oligomers, biomolecular condensates, and
polymeric mixtures. In these systems the solutes phase separate from the
solvent into droplets due to the relatively large free energy gain, which
includes the energies and entropies of mixing with the solvent. Within each
droplet, further phase separation can occur between the two solutes due to an
additional free energy difference that promotes their demixing; in some
systems, the extent of demixing can be, in some cases, be modulated by an
additional component. The minimal free energy topologies are predicted as
universal functions of the interfacial tension ratios and fractions of each

Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds: A Gradient-Free Projection-Based Approach,"Hongye Wang, Zhaoye Pan, Chang He, Jiaxiang Li, Bo Jiang",2025-07-30 17:24:27,"Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained

propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel

finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes

reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a ""simulator"". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" and ""posterior sampling"" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22854v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1,2025-07-31T21:50:18.178376

responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic ""Grover"" speedup in quantum

the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings,
$U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$

"Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases","Archisman Panigrahi, Bitan Roy",2025-07-31 17:59:32,"Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a
higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an
irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is
constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice
that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when
such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an
aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension.
In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological
crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$)
symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological
branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust
endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap
modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being
devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that
such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and
weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states
residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects,
besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we
showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order
topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in
its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline
branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes

Two-dimensional Disordered Projected Branes: Stability and Quantum Criticality via Dimensional Reduction,"Alexander C. Tyner, Vladimir Juricic, Bitan Roy",2025-07-31 17:59:12,"The interplay of disorder and dimensionality governs the emergence and

exhibiting additional semimetal-to-metal transition at moderate disorder,
conventional two-dimensional (2D) non-interacting systems localize for
arbitrarily weak disorder. Here, we show that 2D disordered projected branes,
constructed by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom from a 3D
cubic lattice via the Schur decomposition, faithfully reproduce the full
quantum phase diagram of their 3D parent systems. Using large-scale exact
diagonalization and kernel polynomial method, we numerically demonstrate that
2D projected branes host stable metallic and semimetallic phases. Remarkably,
the critical exponents governing the semimetal-to-metal and metal-insulator
transitions on such 2D projected branes are sufficiently close to those of
their 3D counterparts. Our findings thus establish 2D projected branes as
genuine quantum holographic images of their higher-dimensional disordered
parent crystals, supporting stable semimetallic and metallic phases that are

functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited

addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale

understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an

autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional

Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior,"Nathan Wycoff, Ali Arab, Lisa O. Singh",2025-07-31 17:55:16,"In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently

Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing,Jonathan R. Landers,2025-07-31 17:55:07,"A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the

Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping,"Harshit Kumar Sandhu, Saurav Dutta, Rajesh Chaunsali",2025-07-31 17:48:36,"Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In
this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice

how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a
non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic
damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and
nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The
nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate,
while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity

Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics,Aditya Banerjee,2025-07-31 17:44:01,"Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an
open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary
evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the
latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.
Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state
has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are
non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal
states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of
quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances
non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP
model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of
scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to
have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing
information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between
temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of
subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that
scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)
subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories
associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the
interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to
investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum
many-body systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23757v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757v1,2025-08-01T11:25:58.645539
Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System,Diana Mortagua,2025-07-31 17:41:30,"This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23756v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756v1,2025-08-01T11:25:58.645539
Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility,"W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes",2025-07-31 17:40:56,"The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic
order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While
both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through
the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order
partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's
role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of
geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline
defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that
incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical
basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon
the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.
As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In
ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible
nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of
crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that
elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random
longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order
parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with
pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the
transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of
nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of
long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility
relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results
constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all
crystalline systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23754v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23754v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23754v1,2025-08-01T11:25:58.653502
Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality,"W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes",2025-07-31 17:40:50,"Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying
degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital,
or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of
describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,
by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,
being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility
relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we
develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic
compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase
space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and
thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of
the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any
crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from
pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce
both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results
also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the
mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of
domain formation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23753v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23753v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23753v1,2025-08-01T11:25:58.653502

elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct
orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the
induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these
domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain
fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to
the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of
spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an
underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray

Particle localization on helical nanoribbons: Quantum analog of the Coriolis effect,"Radha Balakrishnan, Rossen Dandoloff, Victor Atanasov, Avadh Saxena",2025-07-31 17:31:48,"We derive the Schr\""odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface
of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials
induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized
states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a
certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a
normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result
suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely
along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted
as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse
deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke
Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized
angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle
is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like
voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall
effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved
surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a
binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron
transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC
voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.

responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic ""Grover"" speedup in quantum
algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in
the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings,
$U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$

higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an
irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is
constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice

such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an
aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension.
In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological
crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$)
symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological
branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust
endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap
modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being
devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that
such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and
weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states
residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects,
besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we
showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order

its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline

functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23772v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23772v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23772v1,2025-08-01T11:42:26.014313
Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior,"Nathan Wycoff, Ali Arab, Lisa O. Singh",2025-07-31 17:55:16,"In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23768v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768v1,2025-08-01T11:42:26.014313
Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing,Jonathan R. Landers,2025-07-31 17:55:07,"A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.

Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping,"Harshit Kumar Sandhu, Saurav Dutta, Rajesh Chaunsali",2025-07-31 17:48:36,"Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In
this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice
that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing
how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a
non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic
damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and
nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The
nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate,
while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity
and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the
enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves and
boundary-induced wave mixing. These findings provide a theoretical framework

Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics,Aditya Banerjee,2025-07-31 17:44:01,"Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an
open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary
evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the
latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.
Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state
has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are
non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal
states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of
quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances
non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP
model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of
scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to
have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing
information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between
temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of
subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that
scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)
subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories
associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the
interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to
investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum
many-body systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23757v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757v1,2025-08-01T11:42:26.018336
Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System,Diana Mortagua,2025-07-31 17:41:30,"This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23756v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756v1,2025-08-01T11:42:26.019048
Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility,"W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes",2025-07-31 17:40:56,"The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic
order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While
both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through
the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order
partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's
role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of
geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline
defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that
incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical
basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon
the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.
As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In
ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible
nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of
crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that
elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random
longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order
parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with
pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the
transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of
nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of
long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility
relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results
constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all
crystalline systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23754v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23754v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23754v1,2025-08-01T11:42:26.019048
Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality,"W. Joe Meese, Rafael M. Fernandes",2025-07-31 17:40:50,"Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying
degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital,
or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of
describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,
by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,
being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility
relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we
develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic
compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase
space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and
thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of
the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any
crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from
pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce
both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results
also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the
mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of
domain formation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23753v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23753v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23753v1,2025-08-01T11:42:26.020870

Fernandes, Zahir Islam, Ian R. Fisher",2025-07-31 17:40:14,"Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy
electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a

elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct
orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the
induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these
domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain
fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to
the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of
spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an
underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray
microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space
resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct
visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the
onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern
inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the

Particle localization on helical nanoribbons: Quantum analog of the Coriolis effect,"Radha Balakrishnan, Rossen Dandoloff, Victor Atanasov, Avadh Saxena",2025-07-31 17:31:48,"We derive the Schr\""odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface
of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials
induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized
states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a
certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a
normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result
suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely
along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted
as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse
deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke
Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized
angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle
is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like
voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall
effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved
surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a
binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron
transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC
voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.
Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends

IGL-Nav: Incremental 3D Gaussian Localization for Image-goal Navigation,"Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Hang Yin, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu",2025-08-01 17:59:56,"Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization

geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation

safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller

extraordinary bandwidth, coherence, and the emergence of strong interactions

Statistical Mechanics of Random Mixed State Ensembles with Fixed Energy,Harry J. D. Miller,2025-08-01 17:43:13,"Mixed state ensembles such as the Bures-Hall and Hilbert-Schmidt measure are

ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars
from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive
the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT
telescope and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \pm
0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet
exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation
period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low
dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg
s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar
to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported
values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS
are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite

Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation,"Richard von Eckardstein, Kai Schmitz, Oleksandr Sobol",2025-08-01 17:24:57,"Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich
phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation
notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which
nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the
model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the
gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that
captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion
gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector,
i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive
parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of
strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the
reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions
that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper

UV flux variation study in contact binary VW Cephei,"Anurag Baruah, Mayukh Pahari",2025-08-01 17:24:01,"Despite many attempts, the origin of UV emission line and continuum in
contact binary stars remains unclear. We present a substantial UV spectroscopic
analysis of VW Cephei, a late-type contact binary system, using 46
low-resolution spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in the
wavelength range 1150-1978 \r{A}. By modelling continuum and emissions lines in
individual spectra, we report the significant detection of OIII] (1660 and 1666

significantly (fractional rms variability up to 45%) from hours to years. In
addition, line widths also change by hundreds of kilometres/sec. The UV flux
variabilities observed in the continuum bands and line emissions are
uncorrelated. However, most of the flux values follow the binary orbital period
observed from optical data. Our analysis indicates that, while the variation in
continuum flux may be attributed to a heated photosphere, the line width
measurements indicate that the emission lines are likely formed in the
dynamical clouds associated with Roche lobe overflow. We estimate the mass

spin texture (PST) - unidirectional spin polarization of states across large
regions of the reciprocal space - in their nonmagnetic metallic phase. Using

transport above magnetic ordering temperatures. At low temperatures, the
materials that order antiferromagnetically become chiral altermagnets, where
spin textures originating from spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetism combine

On the criticality of the configuration-space statistical geometry,"Yu-Jing Liu, Wen-Yu Su, Yong-Feng Yang, Nvsen Ma, Chen Cheng",2025-08-01 17:11:07,"While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local
order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing
the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the
statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the
concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between
this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization
and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal
scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the
normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as
$\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system
possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu < d$. Numerical
stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations on the

perfectly validated in the one-dimensional TFIM, where all theoretical criteria
are satisfied; (ii) Its robustness is confirmed in the two-dimensional TFIM,

limit, our method robustly captures the effective scaling dominated by physical
correlations; (iii) The method's specificity is demonstrated via a critical

On the interaction of dilatancy and friction in the behavior of fluid-saturated sheared granular materials: a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element Method study,"Bimal Chhushyabaga, Behrooz Ferdowsi",2025-08-01 17:10:31,"Frictional instabilities in fluid-saturated granular materials underlie
critical natural hazards such as submarine landslides and earthquake
initiation. Distinct failure behaviors emerge under subaerial and subaqueous
conditions due to the coupled effects of mechanical deformation, interparticle
friction, and fluid interactions. This study employs three-dimensional coupled
Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations to
investigate the collapse and runout dynamics of dense and loose granular
assemblies across these settings. Parametric analyses reveal that pore pressure
evolution plays a central role in governing failure mechanisms: dense
assemblies stabilize through dilation, while loose assemblies undergo rapid
compaction and fluidization, particularly under subaqueous conditions.
Spatiotemporal analyses of coarse-grained fields further highlight
strain-rate-dependent behavior driven by evolving porosity and effective
stress. Both environments exhibit rate-strengthening behavior that scales with
the inertial number (In) and viscous number (Iv), though driven by distinct
mechanisms: subaerial systems are dominated by interparticle contact networks,
whereas subaqueous systems are influenced by fluid drag, pore-pressure buildup,
and lubrication. An analytical solution for excess pore pressure is compared
with breaching-induced pressure distributions from CFD-DEM simulations, using
input parameters derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests. The model captures
fluid-particle coupling effectively, reproducing comparable excess pore
pressures at steady state, while early-time discrepancies underscore the
complexities of transient interactions. These findings advance the

A Kerr soliton Ising machine for combinatorial optimization problems,"Yan Jin, Nitesh Chauhan, Jizhao Zang, Brian Edwards, Pratik Chaudhari, Firooz Aflatouni, Scott B. Papp",2025-08-01 17:45:01,"The growing challenges of scaling digital computing motivate new approaches,
especially through the dynamical evolution of physical systems that mimic
neural networks and combinatorial optimization problems. While light is a hyper
efficient information carrier, intrinsically weak light interactions make
direct information processing difficult to implement. Recently, specialized
nonlinear photonics have opened new controls over light fields with
extraordinary bandwidth, coherence, and the emergence of strong interactions
among nonlinear eigenstates like solitons. We harness an ensemble of hundreds
of Kerr-nonlinear microresonator solitons and implement an analog feedback
network to create an Ising machine with fully programmable all-to-all
interactions. By increasing the feedback for self, on-diagonal interactions,
each soliton exhibits a universal spin-like bifurcation. Using this palette of
interactions amongst the entire soliton ensemble, we encode the Ising machine
to solve the benchmark Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The combination of
uniform soliton interactions and the compatibility of our Ising machine with
high-speed data interconnects enables rapid and precise solutions of complex
SAT problems. Indeed, the soliton properties bound the tradeoff of optical
power and time use by the machine at approximately 10 mW and 1 $\mu$s for a
single feedback step. We performed >10,000 trials on more than 100 randomly
generated SAT instances to evaluate the Ising machine, demonstrating the
potential to exceed the performance of benchmark digital SAT solvers. Our work
highlights the convergence of optical nonlinearity, ultralow loss photonics,

computation-acceleration tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00810v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00810v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00810v1,2025-08-03T22:53:01.083607
Statistical Mechanics of Random Mixed State Ensembles with Fixed Energy,Harry J. D. Miller,2025-08-01 17:43:13,"Mixed state ensembles such as the Bures-Hall and Hilbert-Schmidt measure are
probability distributions that characterise the statistical properties of
random density matrices and can be used to determine the typical features of
mixed quantum states. Here we extend this framework by considering the
properties of random states with fixed average energy, and the
ensemble-averaged density matrix is derived under this additional physical
constraint. This gives rise to a type of microcanonical ensemble for random
mixed states and we connect its properties to a statistical mechanical entropy
and temperature. Our results are illustrated using a variety of simple spin
systems, and we find that they can exhibit exotic features such as phase
transitions in the absence of interactions and finite relative energy

the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT

exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation
period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low
dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg

to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported
values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS

Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation,"Richard von Eckardstein, Kai Schmitz, Oleksandr Sobol",2025-08-01 17:24:57,"Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich
phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation
notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which
nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the
model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the
gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that
captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion
gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector,
i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive
parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of
strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the
reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions
that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper
limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark
radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies

our approach to propose a framework for strong light-matter coupling in which
collective excitations of periodic arrays of quantum emitters are strongly

UV flux variation study in contact binary VW Cephei,"Anurag Baruah, Mayukh Pahari",2025-08-01 17:24:01,"Despite many attempts, the origin of UV emission line and continuum in
contact binary stars remains unclear. We present a substantial UV spectroscopic
analysis of VW Cephei, a late-type contact binary system, using 46
low-resolution spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in the
wavelength range 1150-1978 \r{A}. By modelling continuum and emissions lines in
individual spectra, we report the significant detection of OIII] (1660 and 1666

for both continuum and emission lines like CIV, OIII], CII and SiIV vary
significantly (fractional rms variability up to 45%) from hours to years. In
addition, line widths also change by hundreds of kilometres/sec. The UV flux
variabilities observed in the continuum bands and line emissions are
uncorrelated. However, most of the flux values follow the binary orbital period
observed from optical data. Our analysis indicates that, while the variation in
continuum flux may be attributed to a heated photosphere, the line width
measurements indicate that the emission lines are likely formed in the
dynamical clouds associated with Roche lobe overflow. We estimate the mass

both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework

results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows
for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly
improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong
generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation

transverse flow of multipole moments induced by an electric field. Using
symmetry analysis and linear response theory, we show that the magnetic
octupole Hall effect persists even in symmetries where the spin-splitter effect

unique spin responses to external fields, enabling physical effects rarely

spin texture (PST) - unidirectional spin polarization of states across large
regions of the reciprocal space - in their nonmagnetic metallic phase. Using
the example of NiTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$ and NiNb$_{3}$S$_{6}$, we show that PSTs cover
the full Fermi surface, a rare and desirable feature that enables efficient
charge-to-spin conversion and suggests long spin lifetimes and coherent spin
transport above magnetic ordering temperatures. At low temperatures, the
materials that order antiferromagnetically become chiral altermagnets, where
spin textures originating from spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetism combine
in a way that sensitively depends on the orientation of the Neel vector. Using
symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we classify magnetic
ground states across the family, identify cases with weak ferromagnetism, and
track the evolution of spin textures and charge-to-spin conversion across
magnetic phases and different Neel vector orientations, revealing spin

On the criticality of the configuration-space statistical geometry,"Yu-Jing Liu, Wen-Yu Su, Yong-Feng Yang, Nvsen Ma, Chen Cheng",2025-08-01 17:11:07,"While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local
order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing
the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the
statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the
concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between
this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization
and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal
scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the
normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as
$\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system
possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu < d$. Numerical
stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations on the

perfectly validated in the one-dimensional TFIM, where all theoretical criteria
are satisfied; (ii) Its robustness is confirmed in the two-dimensional TFIM,

limit, our method robustly captures the effective scaling dominated by physical
correlations; (iii) The method's specificity is demonstrated via a critical

On the interaction of dilatancy and friction in the behavior of fluid-saturated sheared granular materials: a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element Method study,"Bimal Chhushyabaga, Behrooz Ferdowsi",2025-08-01 17:10:31,"Frictional instabilities in fluid-saturated granular materials underlie
critical natural hazards such as submarine landslides and earthquake
initiation. Distinct failure behaviors emerge under subaerial and subaqueous
conditions due to the coupled effects of mechanical deformation, interparticle
friction, and fluid interactions. This study employs three-dimensional coupled
Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations to
investigate the collapse and runout dynamics of dense and loose granular
assemblies across these settings. Parametric analyses reveal that pore pressure
evolution plays a central role in governing failure mechanisms: dense
assemblies stabilize through dilation, while loose assemblies undergo rapid
compaction and fluidization, particularly under subaqueous conditions.
Spatiotemporal analyses of coarse-grained fields further highlight
strain-rate-dependent behavior driven by evolving porosity and effective
stress. Both environments exhibit rate-strengthening behavior that scales with
the inertial number (In) and viscous number (Iv), though driven by distinct
mechanisms: subaerial systems are dominated by interparticle contact networks,
whereas subaqueous systems are influenced by fluid drag, pore-pressure buildup,
and lubrication. An analytical solution for excess pore pressure is compared
with breaching-induced pressure distributions from CFD-DEM simulations, using
input parameters derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests. The model captures
fluid-particle coupling effectively, reproducing comparable excess pore
pressures at steady state, while early-time discrepancies underscore the
complexities of transient interactions. These findings advance the
